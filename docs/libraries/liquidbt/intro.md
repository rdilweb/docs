# LiquidBT Introduction

Hello and welcome to the documentation for LiquidBT, a build tool developed by RDIL for fellow Pythonistas.

!!! warning "Early in Development"
    LiquidBT is still being very actively
    developed, and is *not yet ready*. Don't
    use it yet unless you really want to help
    test it.

## Concept

I made LiquidBT because I wasn't happy how many different tools are needed to actually build, test, manage, and deploy Python projects.

LiquidBT is an all-in-one replacement for:

* [setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [wheel](https://wheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Getting Started

See [this guide](./getting-started.md).

??? question "Wait, where is `ibind?`"
    `ibind` has been rebranded to LiquidBT, which
    is built off of the reminants of `ibind`'s codebase.
