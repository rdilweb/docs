Python optimization can be a key to making your code, a web app, data analyzer, machine learning algorithim, or whatever it is, run at its full potential.

Don't frustrate people by building slow software, build software, and let PyPerf take care of performance.

## Installing

Since PyPerf is still in development, this option is not yet usable.

Running this command is all you need to do:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install pyperf
```

That will install the tool from the pre-built binaries.
Finally, you can run this command to run the tool against your source:

```bash
$ pyperf -d path/to/source
```

or, for a single file:

```bash
$ pyperf -f file.py
```
