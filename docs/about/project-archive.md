# RDIL Project Archive

Here you can view some of my projects that have reached the [Deprecated / Unsupported status](./support-policy.md#deprecated-unsupported).

## Snowfall

Source: @gitlab:rdil/Snowfall.

Snowfall is a small script that puts "snowflakes" on your website.
It requires jQuery to function.
It has been archived because it is essentially complete, and I no longer have time to maintain it.

## am-i-cool.pw

Source: @gitlab:rdil/am-i-cool.pw

Just a dumb website in general.
It has been archived because it is no longer hosted.

## Skyblock Leak

A game where you have to press <kbd>Space</kbd> when the dot is over the line.
It is built with Processing for Java, sorted into 3 different difficulties.
All the files needed for runtime are in the repository.
It has been archived because it was just something small I made that I have no intention of maintaining anymore.

## Lowercase Booleans

A library that adds lowercase booleans to Python.
It has been archived because it was very small, and should use the more extensible `lcpy`.

It has been archived because it didn't seem like it was worth keeping afloat.

## Skyblock Minion Cost Calculator

A calculator for the cost of some minions in Hypixel Skyblock.
It has been archived because much better tools exist.
