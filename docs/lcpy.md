# Python Library `lcpy`

`lcpy`, or lowercase values in Python, is a simple library that allows you to use values like `true` instead of `True`.
I created this when I was teaching a student Python who kept forgetting to put in proper uppercase letters.
It is super simple, and has very few drawbacks.

## Installation

The name of the package on PyPI is `lc-py`. (Sorry, `lcpy` was already taken!)

!!! tip "Installing Packages"
    See [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) for how to install packages.

## Usage

To use the library, you will first need to put this at the top of any Python files that you want to use the lowercase values in:

```python
from lcpy import *
```

## Values

If you know the basics, here are the values you can use:

* `true`
* `false`
* `none`
* `exception`
